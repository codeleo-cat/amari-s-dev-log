#그냥퇴사해버리고싶다
최근 불면증이 심해졌어. 한동안 괜찮았는데 또 이러네.
일에서 오는 스트레스 때문 아닐까.
며칠 지나면 괜찮아지겠지?
아 그냥 퇴사해버리고 싶어. 
반복되고 지겨운 일과, 출 퇴근 시간대 혼잡한 지하철이 나의 출근 의욕을 꺾어.
I've been having a lot of insomnia lately.
It was OK for a while. I don't know why it's happening again.
Maybe it's because of stress from work.
I hope it gets better after a few days.
Umm... I wish I could just quit my job.
because routine and tedious work, the rush hour of the crowded subway... those things are dampening my willingness of work.

#그러면나야편하지
(커피 사러 가기 귀찮다... It's a hassle)
저 이미 여러 잔 샀어요. 점심 먹고 잠깐 들를게요.
오 정말요? 그래줄래요? 그러면 저야 고맙죠.
I'll just swing by after lunch.
Oh, really? Would you?
That'll save me so much trouble. Thanks.

#줏대있다
그는 줏대있고, 할말은 하는 스타일이에요. 
He's so based. I have tons of respect for him.
Some might think of it as bluntness,
but I call it being honest and straightforward 
because he's never rude not unless he's treated rudely.

#요즘이거에꽂혔어
나 요즘 그 식당에 꽂혔어.
신복면관 is my new favorite restaurant.

너 이 시간에 여기서 뭐해?
What are you doing here at this hour?
(It's gonna be hard to find a place that's open at that hour.)

#나오늘왜이렇게정신이없지
나 오늘 왜 이렇게 정신이 없지?
I don't know why I didn't think of that.
I've just been having a really foggy day. 

#아뭔지알것같아
I know what you mean.
I know exactly what that is.
I know how you feel.

그냥 딱히 계획 없어. 이번 휴일엔 좀 쉴려고.
Not really. I think I might just lay back this holidays.

#너취직했다며적응잘하고있니
I heard you got a new job! 
So how are you settling in?
Are they treating you OK?

#여기자리비었나요
Is someone sitting here?
