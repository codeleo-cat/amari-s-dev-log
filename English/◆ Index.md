- 아쉬움을 표현할 때 : ok 정도이긴 한데, 내 예상만큼 좋진 않았어 의 뉘앙스로 접근

**It was OK but it wasn't as good as I'd hoped.**
오늘 먹은 제육볶음은 그냥 저냥 괜찮기는 한데, 내 예상만큼 좋진 않았어.
Stir-fried pork I ate today was OK but **it wasn't as good as I'd hoped**.

I feel like the dependency between resources wasn't very well-structured.
I mean, there were a few logics, a sort of connection that didn't make much sense. They made it very confusing.
for example, when it comes to relating private_dns_zone and application gateway, or deciding specific role about key vault access policy.

- 나도 완전 공감돼.
That makes two of us

- 아 뭐 늘 그렇지 뭐 ~
So, what else is new 

- 네 입장에선 쉽지 (너니까 그렇게 쉽게 말하지)
Easy for you to say
  
- 그냥 ~ 하다는 것 뿐이야. " It's just that ~ "
We get along fine. **It's just that we're both really stubborn.**
It's just that it doesn't seem like we have very much in common, you know.


- [좋다 말았네](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfPXSGZYvmo)
So much for that
So much for getting off work on time (에이~ 정시에 퇴근할 수 있나 했더니 좋다 말았네)

- 그냥 퇴사해버리고 싶은 때가 있지 ... (퇴사 could 하는 것을 wish 하지만 안됨. )

of course. But **just because**
there are times when I wish I could just quit my job
**that doesn't mean** I don't like my job.
I love what I do, but the company, itself matters.
because we do "same work, same job" and meet "same people" everyday.
Most of people live like that, though.
Sometime I fed up with this sort of rat racing life

As far as I know : 내가 알기로는
From what I’v heard : 내가 듣기로는 
As far as I can tell / The way I see it : 내가 보기에는


**I hung out with some friends who I hadn’t seen in a long time : 오랫동안 못 봤던 친구들을 만났어.**

**(행위) I hadn’t done that in a long time : (행위) 자체를 오랜만에 해.**

**I’m gonna go ride my bike today along the Han-River : 나 오늘 한강에 자전거 타러 갈거야.**

여기서 거기까지.. 걸어서 한 10분 정도 걸려요.
It’s about a 10 minutes walk from here to there.
 
집에서 회사까지 지하철로 25분 정도 걸려요. 
It takes about 25 minutes from my home to work by subway.
(25분 정도 걸려요 / 집에서 회사까지 / 지하철로)  *수단을 맨 뒤로 보내서, 수식*

1년째 여기서 살고 있어요.
I've been living here for an year.

You must not expect your parents to do everything for you : 네 부모님이 널 위해서 모든 걸 해줄 거라고 기대해서는 안돼.

Hey! Get on the subway! : 지하철 타 ! 
Get off the subway! : 지하철 내려!
 

I can’t wait to get the new iPhone 15 : 아이폰 15 얼른 갖고 싶다. 완전 들떠!

**He made the move on me : 그 (놈이) 가 나한테 추근댔어.** 
  

**It was on the pricier side, I don’t know anywhere else that makes them(피자) like that.** 

**좀 비싼 편이긴 했는데, 다른 곳에서 그렇게 만드는 것은 못 봤어 (을지로 더 랜치 브루잉. 피자 엣지가 완전 crispy 했어)**

  

**There are only so many hours in day : 하루의 시간에는 한계가 있죠.**

**I can only do so many things at a time : 내가 동시에 할 수 있는 일에는 한계가 있잖아.**

Do you wanna do this ? Do you wanna keep this ? Do you wanna see me cry?

I’m not gonna eat anything. I’m not gonna threaten. Oh, shoot. Am I gonna get a ticket? We’re gonna lunch. We’re gonna figure this out.
