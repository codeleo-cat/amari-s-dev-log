# I wish I could just quit my job

그냥 퇴사해 버리고 싶다 
I wish I could just quit my job

화장 지우기 귀찮아. 지금 꼭 해야 하나
I don't wanna remove my make up. Do I have to do it now?

병원에 가 봐야 하나?
I wonder if I should see a doctor. *[슏:see]*

병원에 가봐야겠다.
I should probably (go) see a doctor.

핸드폰을 너무 많이 했나봐.
I think I spend too much time on the phone.
I must've spent too much time ~

왜 이렇지? 어제 잘못 잤나?
What's wrong? Did I sleep wrong?

자세가 안 좋아서 그래. (=너 자세 고쳐야 해)
You gotta fix your posture.

병원에 가 봤어? 신경성 아니야?
Have you seen a doctor?
May it's because of stress.

**한동안** 괜찮았는데 또 이렇네.
It was OK **for a while**. I don't know why it's **happening** again.

오늘 무리했나 봐.
I must've overdone it today.

왜 자꾸 이러지?
Why does this keep **happening**?

며칠 **지나면** 괜찮아지겠지?
I hope it gets better **after** a few days.

늙어서 서러워.
Getting old sucks.
