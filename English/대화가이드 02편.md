How was your weekend? Did you do something?

Not much. You? Didn't you say you were gonna get a new phone?

Oh (that's) right! Check it out ~

Congratulations! What about your old one? Is it broken?

Yeah, I think so. 
I've tried getting it fixed a couple of times
but for some reason, it kept causing problem.
So I decided to get a new one.
