### 1. cluster upgrade
Concept...
The master node 
- hosts the Kubernetes control plane and 
- manages the cluster, including **scheduling** and **scaling** applications and maintaining the state of the cluster. 
The worker nodes 
- are responsible for running the **containers** and executing the workloads.

*master node upgrade*
1. master node drain
2. master node - kubeadm upgrade
3. master node - kubelet, kubectl upgrade & daemon restart
4. master node - uncordon

*worker node upgrade*
1. worker node drain
2. ssh worker node
3. worker node kubeadm upgrade
4. worker node kubelet, kubectl upgrade & daemon restart
5. workder node uncordon

### 2. ETCD snapshot save & restore

### 3. Trouble Shooting
- 특정 node를 NotReady > Ready 상태가 되도록.
k get no
ssh `node name`
sudo -i
systemctl status kubelet    # inactive
systemctl restart kubelet
systemctl status kubelet    # active

1) pvc 생성 후 pod와 연동 (PV는 이미 존재). PVC 용량 수정
k get sc
